Description: The 'permute' package implements a set of restricted permutation designsfor freely exchangeable, line transects (time series), and spatial grid designs plus permutation of blocks (groups of samples). 'permute' also allows split-plot designs, in which the whole-plots or split-plots or both can be freely-exchangeble or one of the restricted designs.
